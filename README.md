My Rice for Bspwm

## Prerequisites

Install Archlinux with bspwm.
To speed up process you can use the `archinstall` command and select the installation profile as Desktop with bspwm.
Of course, if you are new to Archlinux, i fully recommend you to install it on your own to learn how linux works.



## Description
This is my personal rice of Archlinux + bspwm, including:

- BSPWM and SXHKD configuration and keybindings
- Polybar configuration and scripts
- A custom .Xresources color palette
- GTK theme
- rofi custom menus and configurations
- dunst notifications
- Kitty configuration (todo)
- alacritty configuration (todo)


### Note
This configuration is a mix of my own and various config files I took from people (mainly found on unixporn reddit)
Here are my inspiration and also others interresting configs to look:
